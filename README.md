# WorkDayPlanner
<b>Welcome to my work day planner.</b>

This application will allow you to save important events to help organize your work day more effectively!

Visit here --> https://gammahazard.github.io/WorkDayPlanner/


  Upon opening the application you will be presented with the current day of the week and current time.




  Underneath you will notice 8 separate blocks divided into the hours from 9AM-5PM, simply write down important events scehduled for your day and click save.

*Events will persist after page refresh, clear button is not working, to clear for now please delete entry and re-save*


  Blocks will be displayed color-coded based on the current time of day: 

    Grey blocks means the time has passed white blocks means it is currently time for that event.
   
   
    White blocks mean it is currently time for that event.
   
   
    Teal blocks indicate the event is scehduled for the future.
   
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
How it looks
(In my picture all blocks are grey as it is 10pm, at midnight when the next day arrives, the blocks will turn teal, indicating they are in the future)
